# WebSocket Limitation in Vercel Serverless

## Issue
The original Express server used Socket.IO for real-time updates when products, services, testimonials, or blog posts were updated. However, Vercel serverless functions don't support persistent WebSocket connections.

## Original WebSocket Usage
The server was using Socket.IO to broadcast updates when:
- Products were updated
- Services were updated  
- Testimonials were updated
- Blog posts were updated

## Alternatives for Real-time Updates

### 1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
Replace WebSocket with Server-Sent Events for one-way real-time updates:
```typescript
// Example SSE endpoint
export default async function handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse) {
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  });
  
  // Send periodic updates or use a database trigger
  // Note: This still has limitations in serverless
}
```

### 2. Polling
Implement client-side polling to check for updates:
```typescript
// Client-side polling every 30 seconds
const pollForUpdates = () => {
  setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/check-updates');
    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.hasUpdates) {
      // Refresh the UI
      window.location.reload();
    }
  }, 30000);
};
```

### 3. External WebSocket Service
Use a third-party service like:
- Pusher
- Ably
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Supabase Realtime (if using Supabase)

### 4. Database Triggers + Webhooks
Set up database triggers that call webhooks when data changes, then use a service like Pusher to broadcast updates.

## Recommendation
For a production application, I recommend using **Supabase Realtime** (if you're already using Supabase) or **Pusher** for real-time updates, as they provide reliable WebSocket connections that work well with serverless architectures.

## Current State
The serverless functions are functional but will not provide real-time updates. The admin interface will need to be refreshed manually to see changes, or you'll need to implement one of the alternatives above.
